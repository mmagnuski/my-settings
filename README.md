# my-settings
Settings I use in Atom, sublime, AutoHotkey scripts, this kind of stuff... 

### `atom`
I am using vim mode with some key bindings adapted to work more like in Sublime Text that I previously used. I also use `ctrl-c` and `ctrl-v` for copying and pasting (although I also use `y` and `p`) and didn't want to quit this habit.

### `sublime`
Currently it is Vitage mode (but maybe I am going to try Vintageous some time) with keymapping 
adapted to work with some Sublime Text native features. For example: `ctrl+alt+j` 
instead of `ctrl+alt+down` for multi-cursor selection.

Currently this is quite basic stuff, but will grow hopefully.
