# my-sublime-settings
Settings I use with sublime. 
Currently it is Vitage mode (but I am going to try Vintageous) with keymapping 
adapted to work with some Sublime Text native features. For example: `ctrl+alt+j` 
instead of `ctrl+alt+down` for multi-cursor selection.

Currently this is quite basic stuff, but will grow hopefully.
