# my-settings
Atom and sublime settings, AutoHotkey scripts. 

### `atom`
I am using vim mode with some key bindings adapted to work more like in Sublime Text that I previously used. I also use `ctrl-c` and `ctrl-v` for copying and pasting (although I also use `y` and `p`) and didn't want to quit this habit.

### `sublime`
Vintage mode with keymapping adapted to work with some Sublime Text native features. For example: `ctrl+alt+j` instead of `ctrl+alt+down` for multi-cursor selection.
